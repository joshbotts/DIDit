# DIDit
Diplomatic and Institutional Data Information Tool
A tool for maintaining history.state.gov datasets

This app provides an iOS/MacOS-native interface for working on ongoing diplomatic and institutional data initiatives undertaken by the Office of the Historian.

The current version of the app has limited functionality. It relies on bundled json files that have been manually scrubbed to initialize POCOM data. It allows limited flexibility in viewing data. Existing principal officer and chief of mission role data cannot be edited. Export capabilities are limited to copying xml elements to the clipboard. It does not include the travels and visits component of the overall DID effort. These limitations will be addressed in future versions.
