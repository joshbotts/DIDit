xquery version "3.1";

(: Generates a single file out of all POCOM people records.

   Directions:
   
   Run this query in oXygen's XQuery debugger view (using the "Debugger" menu >
   "XQuery Debugger"), with the query selected in the toolbar's XQuery dropdown.
   
   To ensure the query can find the necessary source files, update the $username
   variable below.
   
   The query will generate a new "people.xml" file on your Desktop. To save the
   file elsewhere, update the $destination-directory variable.
:)

let $username := "jbotts"
let $home-directory := "file:/Users/" || $username
let $pocom-directory := $home-directory || "/workspace/hsg-project/repos/pocom"
let $saxon-collection-params :=

    "?recurse=yes&amp;select=*.xml"
let $new-data :=
    element people {
        collection($pocom-directory || "/people" || $saxon-collection-params)
    }
let $destination-directory := $home-directory || "/Desktop/"
let $destination-uri := $destination-directory || "people.xml"
